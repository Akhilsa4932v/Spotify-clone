# Spotify Clone with HTML & CSS
Focusing purely on the front-end aspect using HTML and CSS. This project aims to mirror the visual aspects of Spotify's web version, capturing its essence and functionality through static web pages.
Recreating such a design was both a challenge and a fantastic learning opportunity. This clone attempts to replicate several key features of Spotify, including the homepage, the search functionality layout, and the library page

# Technologies Used
HTML: Used for structuring the web content and creating the foundational layout of the Spotify clone.


CSS: Employed for styling, including the layout, colors, fonts  Flexbox and Grid were used extensively to align content and design a layout that mimics Spotify's original design.

A landing page that resembles Spotify's own, complete with navigation and a sample of featured playlists.
A responsive design that adapts to various screen sizes, ensuring that the clone looks good on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
Custom icons and images that are placeholders for Spotify's actual data.
